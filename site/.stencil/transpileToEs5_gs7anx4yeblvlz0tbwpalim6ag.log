First, Capacitor has much less tooling for native project management. Instead, Capacitor enables you to check your native projects into source control and manage them as a source asset. This means fewer Capacitor-specific tools that can break in unexpected ways, and an easier escape-hatch for adding native code or working with existing native development teams/libraries.
