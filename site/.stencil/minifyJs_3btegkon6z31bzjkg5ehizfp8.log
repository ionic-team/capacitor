Capacitor comes with tooling to help create projects for each platform you\'re targeting, along with a plugin API for extending and exposing native functionality to your web code. Finally, Capacitor comes with a middleware layer that enables your code to run both on native platforms *and* on the web as a Progressive Web App, all with the same code.'),e("p",null,"Capacitor solves a similar problem to Cordova, so Capacitor will replace Cordova in a typical hybrid app, while providing backwards compatibility with most existing Cordova plugins.

First, Capacitor has much less tooling for native project management. Instead, Capacitor enables you to check your native projects into source control and manage them as a source asset. This means fewer Capacitor-specific tools that can break in unexpected ways, and an easier escape-hatch for adding native code or working with existing native development teams/libraries. For those used to doing everything from the Cordova CLI, expect to change to spending more time in the platform-specific IDE for testing/running (such as Xcode, Android Studio, etc.)"),e("p",null,"Compared to React Native, Native Script, Flutter, and the many other cross-platform options focused on Native UI, Capacitor is web-native, and enables developers to build one app that runs just as well in the app stores as it does on Electron and on the web as a Progressive Web App. Perfect for teams that continue to support multi-screen environments or want to use pure web standards to build their apps."),e("h2",null,"What's next?"),e("p",null,"With Capacitor entering beta, we are working hard towards 1.0, production-ready status.
