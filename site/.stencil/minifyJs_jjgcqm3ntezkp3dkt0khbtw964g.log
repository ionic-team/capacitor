First, Capacitor has much less tooling for native project management. Instead, Capacitor enables you to check your native projects into source control and manage them as a source asset. This means fewer Capacitor-specific tools that can break in unexpected ways, and an easier escape-hatch for adding native code or working with existing native development teams/libraries. For those used to doing everything from the Cordova CLI, expect to change to spending more time in the platform-specific IDE for testing/running (such as Xcode, Android Studio, etc.)"),t("p",null,"Compared to React Native, Native Script, Flutter, and the many other cross-platform options focused on Native UI, Capacitor is web-native, and enables developers to build one app that runs just as well in the app stores as it does on Electron and on the web as a Progressive Web App. Perfect for teams that continue to support multi-screen environments or want to use pure web standards to build their apps."),t("h2",null,"What's next?"),t("p",null,"With Capacitor entering beta, we are working hard towards 1.0, production-ready status.
