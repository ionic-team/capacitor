<h1 id="capacitor-native-progressive-web-apps">Capacitor: Native Progressive Web Apps</h1>
<p>Capacitor is a cross-platform app runtime that makes it easy to build web apps that run
natively on iOS, Android, Electron, <em>and</em> the web. We call these apps &quot;Native Progressive Web Apps&quot; and they represent the next evolution beyond Hybrid apps.</p>
<p>Capacitor provides a consistent, web-focused set of APIs that enable an app to stay as close to web-standards as possible,
while accessing rich native device features on platforms that support them. Adding native functionalty is easy with a simple Plugin API for Swift on iOS, Java on Android, and JavaScript for the web.</p>
<p>Capacitor is a spiritual successor to Apache Cordova and Adobe PhoneGap, with inspiration from other popular cross-platform tools like React Native and Turbolinks, but focused entirely on enabling modern web apps to run on all major platforms with ease. Capacitor has backwards-compatible support for many existing Cordova plugins.</p>
