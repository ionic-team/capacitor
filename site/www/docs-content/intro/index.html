<h1 id="avocado-native-progressive-web-apps">Avocado: Native Progressive Web Apps</h1>
<p>Avocado is a cross-platform app runtime that makes it easy to deploy a Progressive Web App
natively on iOS, Android, Electron, <em>and</em> the web.</p>
<p>Avocado provides a consistent, web-focused set of APIs that enable an app to stay as close to web-standards as possible,
while accessing rich native device features on platforms that support them.</p>
<p>Avocado is a spiritual successor to Apache Cordova and Adobe PhoneGap, focused on enabling modern web apps to run on all major platforms with ease. Avocado has backwards-compatible support for many existing Cordova plugins.</p>
