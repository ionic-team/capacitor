<h1 id="browser-support">Browser Support</h1>
<p>Stencil builds Web Components that run natively or near-natively in all widely used browsers.</p>
<p>Web Components are a set of standardized browser APIs centered around the Custom Elements v1 spec, a cross-browser way to define and create essentially new HTML tags, and is the successor to the now-defunct v0 spec.</p>
<p>Custom Elements are natively supported in Chrome and Safari (including iOS!) and are coming to both Edge
and Firefox. In fact, Firefox has native support behind a flag, indicating full native support is near.</p>
<p>For browsers without native support, a small polyfill helps developers use Custom Elements seamlessly and with little performance overhead.</p>
<p>Stencil uses a dynamic loader to load the custom elements polyfill only on browsers that need it. With this polyfill Stencil&#39;s browser support is Chrome (and all chrome based browsers), Safari, Firefox, Edge, and IE11.</p>
<p>Web Components are being used in production in 2017 with the above approach.</p>
