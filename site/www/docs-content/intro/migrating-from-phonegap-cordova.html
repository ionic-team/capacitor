<p>Avocado can be used as a replacement for Cordova/PhoneGap in many cases. The two projects provide a web environment with full access to native features and functionality, but with a few differences in their approach to tooling, native project management, and plugins.</p>
<h2 id="differences-between-avocado-and-cordova">Differences between Avocado and Cordova</h2>
<p>Avocado has a few differences in approach that require changing app development workflows.</p>
<p>First, Avocado considers each platform project a <em>source asset</em> instead of a build time asset. That means you&#39;ll check in your Xcode and Android Studio projects, as well as use those IDEs when necessary for platform-specific configuration and running/testing.</p>
<p>We do this for a few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It&#39;s easier to add custom native code that your app might need</li>
<li>Updating and modifying native projects through abstracted-away tools is error prone and a moving target</li>
<li>Adding Native UI shell around your web app is easier when you &quot;own&quot; the project</li>
<li>Running iOS apps from the command line is not officially supported by Apple, so Xcode is preferred</li>
</ol>
<p>This change in approach has a few implications. First, Avocado does not use <code>config.xml</code> or a similar custom configuration for platform settings; all configuration is done by editing the appropriate platform-specific configuration files directly, such as <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> for Android, and <code>Info.plist</code> for Xcode.</p>
<p>Avocado does not run on device or emulate through the command line. Instead, such operations are done through the platform-specific IDE which we believe provides a faster, more typical experience that follows the standards of app development for that platform.</p>
