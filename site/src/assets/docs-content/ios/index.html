<h1 id="capacitor-ios-documentation">Capacitor iOS Documentation</h1>
<p>Capacitor features a native iOS bridge that enables developers to communicate between JavaScript and Native Swift or Objective-C code.</p>
<p>Capacitor iOS apps are configured and managed through Xcode, with dependencies managed by CocoaPods.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>Building iOS apps requires some iOS development dependencies to be installed, including Xcode 9 and the Xcode command line tools.</p>
<p>Note: It&#39;s possible to develop and build iOS apps without a mac, such as by using Ionic Pro&#39;s Package service. Consult your service of choice for more information.</p>
<h3 id="creating-ios-app">Creating iOS App</h3>
<p>By default, an iOS project is created for every Capacitor project. If you are adding Capacitor to an existing
project, you can manually add the iOS project using</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">npx <span class="hljs-built_in">cap</span> add ios
npx <span class="hljs-built_in">cap</span> sync
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>sync</code> command updates dependencies, and copies any web assets to your project. You can also run</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">npx <span class="hljs-built_in">cap</span> copy
</code></pre>
<p>To copy web assets only, which is faster if you know you don&#39;t need to update native dependencies.</p>
<h3 id="opening-ios-project">Opening iOS Project</h3>
<p>To open the project in Xcode, run</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">npx <span class="hljs-built_in">cap</span> open ios
</code></pre>
<h3 id="running-your-app">Running Your App</h3>
<p>Once Xcode is open, just click the Play button to run your app on a Simulator or Device. </p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>
<p>If your app ran you are now ready to continue developing and building your app. Use the various APIs available, Capacitor or Cordova plugins, or custom native code to build our the rest of your app.</p>
