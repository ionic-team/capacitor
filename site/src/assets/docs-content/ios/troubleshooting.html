<h1 id="ios-troubleshooting-guide">iOS Troubleshooting Guide</h1>
<p>Creating a 100% perfect native management tool is nearly impossible, and sooner or later you&#39;ll run into various issues with some part of the iOS workflow.</p>
<p>This guide attempts to document common iOS/Xcode issues with possible solutions.</p>
<h2 id="ios-toolbox">iOS Toolbox</h2>
<p>Every iOS developer learns a few common techniques for debugging iOS issues, and you should incorporate these into your workflow:</p>
<h3 id="google-google-google">Google, Google, Google</h3>
<p>Any time you encounter an issue with iOS, or Xcode, your first step should be to copy and paste the error into a Google search.</p>
<p>Capacitor uses the standard iOS toolchain, so chances are if you run into something, many iOS developers have as well, and there&#39;s a solution out there.</p>
<p>It could be as simple as updating a dependency, running clean, or removing Derived Data</p>
<h3 id="clean-rebuild">Clean/Rebuild</h3>
<p>Cleaning and rebuilding can fix a number of build issues. Navigate to Product -&gt; Clean in the Xcode menu to clean your current build.</p>
<h3 id="removing-derived-data">Removing Derived Data</h3>
<p>Sometimes, Xcode clings to old, outdated build artifacts. To start fresh, you&#39;ll need to delete any Derived Data on disk.</p>
<p>To do this, open Xcode Preferences, choose the Locations tab, and click the small arrow next to your Derived Data path:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/docs/ios/location-prefs.png" alt="Locations"></p>
<p>This opens a Finder window to the location of Xcode&#39;s temporary Derived Data.</p>
<p>Next, select all items in that directory and delete:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/docs/ios/deleting-derived-data.png" alt="Deleting Derived Data"></p>
<p>Finally, do a rebuild in Xcode.</p>
<h2 id="error-unable-to-export-required-bridge-javascript">Error: Unable to export required Bridge JavaScript</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/img/docs/ios/export-bridge.png" alt="Can&#39;t export"></p>
<p>This error occurs when Capacitor&#39;s <code>native-bridge.js</code> file was not copied to the native project.</p>
<p>The fix is simple: run <code>npx cap copy ios</code> to copy this file.</p>
<h2 id="error-sandbox-not-in-sync-with-the-podfile-lock">Error: Sandbox not in sync with the Podfile.lock</h2>
<p>This error can happen if CocoaPods hasn&#39;t been able to run to install your dependencies.</p>
<p>Run</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">npx <span class="hljs-built_in">cap</span> update ios
</code></pre>
<p>To update your pods. Perform a new build after running this command.</p>
<h2 id="indexing-forever">Indexing FOREVER</h2>
<p>Xcode sometimes gets stuck indexing forever. This unfortunate situation looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/docs/ios/indexing.png" alt="Xcode indexing"></p>
<p>The only solution is to Force Close Xcode (using Activity Monitor) and start it up again.</p>
<h2 id="cocoapods-failed-to-connect-to-github">CocoaPods: Failed to connect to GitHub</h2>
<p>This error can happen on Mac&#39;s with an old version of openssl and ruby installed, since GitHub
restricted the allowed cryptographic protocols when accessing repos.</p>
<p>The solution is to update openssl and update Ruby:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">brew install openssl
brew upgrade openssl
brew install ruby
brew link --overwrite ruby
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, make sure your <code>PATH</code> environment variable does not put <code>/usr/local/bin</code> after <code>$PATH</code>, but rather <em>before</em> it.</p>
