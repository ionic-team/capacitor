<h1 id="capacitor-native-progressive-web-apps">Capacitor: Native Progressive Web Apps</h1>
<p>Capacitor is a cross-platform app runtime that makes it easy to build web apps that run natively on iOS, Android, Electron, <em>and</em> the web. We call these apps &quot;Native Progressive Web Apps&quot; and they represent the next evolution beyond Hybrid apps.</p>
<p>Capacitor provides a consistent, web-focused set of APIs that enable an app to stay as close to web-standards as possible, while accessing rich native device features on platforms that support them. Adding native functionalty is easy with a simple Plugin API for Swift on iOS, Java on Android, and JavaScript for the web.</p>
<p>Capacitor is a spiritual successor to <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/">Apache Cordova</a> and <a href="https://phonegap.com/">Adobe PhoneGap</a>, with inspiration from other popular cross-platform tools like <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native</a> and <a href="https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks">Turbolinks</a>, but focused entirely on enabling modern web apps to run on all major platforms with ease. Capacitor has backwards-compatible support for many existing <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/plugins/">Cordova plugins</a>.</p>
<p>Getting started with Capacitor is easy! Capacitor can be used as a drop in to any existing modern JavaScript project, or used to create a fresh Capacitor project from scratch.</p>
