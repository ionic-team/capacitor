<p>When developing an app that uses Capacitor, it&#39;s possible to add both Cordova and Ionic Native plugins to it.</p>
<h2 id="using-ionic-native">Using Ionic Native</h2>
<p>Ionic Native is supported in Capacitor. Currently, Ionic Native contains only Cordova plugins, so whenever you find an Ionic Native wrapper you&#39;d like to use, install it and then install the corresponding Cordova plugin by running</p>
<p>npm install your-cordova-plugin
npx cap update</p>
<h2 id="installing-cordova-plugins">Installing Cordova Plugins</h2>
<p>Simply <code>npm install</code> your plugin of choice, sync your project, finish configuration, and you&#39;re ready to go:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">npm install cool-cordova-plugin
npx <span class="hljs-built_in">cap</span> sync
</code></pre>
<h2 id="important-configuration">Important: Configuration</h2>
<p>Capacitor does not support Cordova install variables, auto configuration, or hooks, due to our philosophy of letting you control your native project source code (meaning things like hooks are unnecessary). If your plugin requires variables or settings to be set, you&#39;ll need to apply those configuration settings manually by mapping between the plugin&#39;s <code>plugin.xml</code> and required settings on iOS and Android.</p>
<p>Consult the <a href="../ios/configuration">iOS</a> and <a href="../android/configuration">Android</a> configuration guides for info on how to configure each platform.</p>
<h2 id="compatibility-issues">Compatibility Issues</h2>
<p>Some Cordova plugins don&#39;t work with Capacitor, or Capacitor provides a conflicting alternative. If it&#39;s known that the plugin is conflicting or causes build issues, it will be skipped when running <code>npx cap update</code>.</p>
<p>While we&#39;ve tested a number of popular Cordova plugins, it&#39;s possible Capacitor doesn&#39;t support every Cordova plugin. If you find an issue with an existing Cordova plugin, please <a href="https://github.com/ionic-team/capacitor/issues/new">file an issue</a> with the issue you&#39;ve found and the plugin information.</p>
