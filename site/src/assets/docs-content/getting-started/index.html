<h1 id="installing-capacitor">Installing Capacitor</h1>
<p>There are two ways to start using Capacitor: adding Capacitor to an existing frontend project (recommended), or starting a fresh project. Capacitor was designed primarily to drop-in to existing frontend projects, but comes with a simple starting project structure if you&#39;d like to start fresh.</p>
<p>Capacitor provides a native mobile runtime and API layer for web apps. It does <em>not</em> come with any specific
set of UI controls which you will most likely need unless you&#39;re building a game or something similar.</p>
<p>We strongly recommend starting a Capacitor project with your mobile frontend framework of choice (such as <a href="https://ionicframework.com">Ionic</a>).</p>
<h2 id="before-you-start">Before you start</h2>
<p>Make sure you have all the required <a href="./dependencies">Dependencies</a> installed for the platforms you will be building for. Most importantly,
make sure you update CocoaPods using <code>pod repo update</code> before starting a new project, if you plan on building for iOS using a Mac.</p>

<p><a href="/docs/getting-started/with-ionic">See here.</a></p>
<h2 id="adding-capacitor-to-an-existing-web-app">Adding Capacitor to an existing web app</h2>
<p>Capacitor was designed to drop-in to any existing modern JS web app. A valid <code>package.json</code> file and a folder containing all web assets are required to get started.</p>
<p>To add Capacitor to your web app, run the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>cd my-app
npm install --save @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli
</code></pre><p>Then, initialize Capacitor with your app information.</p>
<p><em>Note: <code>npx</code> is a new utility available in npm 5 or above that executes local binaries/scripts to avoid global installs.</em></p>
<pre><code>npx cap init
</code></pre><p>This command will prompt you to enter the name of your app and the app id (the package name for Android and the bundle identifier for iOS). Use the <code>--web-dir</code> flag to set the web assets folder (the default is <code>www</code>).</p>
<p>Next, install any of the desired native platforms:</p>
<pre><code>npx cap add android
npx cap add ios
npx cap add electron
</code></pre><p>ðŸŽ‰ Capacitor is now installed in your project. ðŸŽ‰</p>
<h2 id="optional-starting-a-fresh-project">Optional: Starting a fresh project</h2>
<p>Capacitor comes with a stock project structure if you&#39;d rather start fresh and plan to add a UI/frontend framework separately.</p>
<p>To create it, run:</p>
<pre><code>npx @capacitor/cli create
</code></pre><p>This command will prompt you to enter the name of your app and the app id (the package name for Android and the bundle identifier for iOS).</p>
<p>This will create a very simple starting app with no UI library.</p>

<p>Make sure you have the <a href="/docs/getting-started/dependencies">Required Dependencies</a> installed, including <a href="/docs/getting-started/pwa-elements">PWA Elements</a>, then proceed to the
<a href="/docs/basics/workflow">Developer Workflow Guide</a> to learn how Capacitor apps are built.</p>
