Soon, you&#39;ll be able to use <a href=\"http://ionicframework.com/appflow\">Ionic Appflow</a> to build for iOS even if you&#39;re on Windows.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you&#39;ll need to install <strong><a href=\"https://cocoapods.org/\">CocoaPods</a></strong> (<code>sudo gem install cocoapods</code>), and install the <strong>Xcode Command Line tools</strong> (either from Xcode, or running <code>xcode-select --install</code>).</p>\n<p>Once you have CocoaPods installed, update your local repo by running <code>pod repo update</code>. You should run this command periodically to ensure you have the latest versions of CocoaPods dependencies.</p>\n<p>As a rule, the latest version of Capacitor always supports the last two iOS versions. For example, iOS 11 and iOS 12. For support for older versions of iOS, use an older version of Capacitor (if available).</p>\n<p>Capacitor uses the WKWebView.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"android-development\">\n  <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#android-development\"><app-icon name=\"link\"></app-icon>\n  Android Development\n  </a>\n</h2>\n<p>First, the <strong>Java 8 JDK</strong> must be installed and <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/24657630/32140\">set to the default</a> if you have other versions of the JDK installed. Java 9 does <em>not</em> work at the moment.</p>\n<p>Android development requires the <strong>Android SDK</strong> installed with <strong><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html\">Android Studio</a></strong>. Technically, Android Studio isn&#39;t required as you can build and run apps using only the Android CLI tools, but it will make building and running your app much easier so we strongly recommend using it.</p>\n<p>Android version support for Capacitor is more complex than iOS. Currently, we are targeting API level 21 or greater, meaning Android 5.0 (Lollipop) or above. <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards\">As of May 2019</a>, this represents over 89% of the Android market.</p>\n<p>Also, Capacitor requires an Android WebView with Chrome version 50 or later. On Android 5 and 6, the Capacitor uses the System WebView. On Android 7+, Google Chrome is used.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"electron-development\">\n  <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#electron-development\"><app-icon name=\"link\"></app-icon>\n  Electron Development\n  </a>\n</h2>\n<p>No specific dependencies are needed to use Capacitor with Electron.</p>\n"}
