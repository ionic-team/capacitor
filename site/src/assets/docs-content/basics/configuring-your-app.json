However,\nwe think this is the right approach, because it makes it easy to follow existing Native iOS/Android guides, get help on Stack Overflow, and have full control over your project.</p>\n<p>Additionally, because configuring a Capacitor project is no different from configuring an iOS or Android project, existing native development teams can easily work alongside\nweb developers, with each side using the tools and SDKs they are familiar with. Of course, we believe web developers can handle all the required Native configuration on their own, and \nthe Capacitor documentation exists to help web developers do just that.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"common-configuration\">\n  <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#common-configuration\"><app-icon name=\"link\"></app-icon>\n  Common Configuration\n  </a>\n</h2>\n<p>Capacitor has some high level configuration options that are set in <code>capacitor.config.json</code>. These generally don&#39;t modify native functionality, but control Capacitor&#39;s tooling.</p>\n<p>The current ones you might configure are:</p>\n\n  <highlight-code-line >\n    <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\">{\n  // Sets the directory of your built web assets.
