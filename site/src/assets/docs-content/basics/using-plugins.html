<h1 id="using-capacitor-plugins">Using Capacitor Plugins</h1>
<p>Capacitor ships with a number of built-in plugins, known as Capacitor APIs, such as <a href="/docs/apis/camera">Camera</a> and <a href="/docs/apis/filesystem">Filesystem</a>.</p>
<p>However, chances are your app will need to access more native functionality than provided out of the box in Capacitor.</p>
<p>If you are willing and able to write a small amount of native code, you can quickly add your own native functionality and expose it as a Capacitor plugin by following the <a href="/docs/plugins/">Plugin Guide</a>.</p>
<h2 id="finding-plugins">Finding Plugins</h2>
<p>The community has built a number of plugins for various native functionality and you can easily add them to your app.</p>
<p>See our <a href="/docs/community/plugins/">Community Plugins</a> list for some options.</p>
<h2 id="using-cordova-and-ionic-native-plugins">Using Cordova and Ionic Native Plugins</h2>
<p>Capacitor also supports a wide range of <a href="/docs/cordova/using-cordova-plugins">Cordova plugins</a>, so there are a lot to choose from.</p>
