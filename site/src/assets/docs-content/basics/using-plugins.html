<h1 id="using-capacitor-plugins">Using Capacitor Plugins</h1>
<p>Capacitor ships with a number of built-in plugins, known as Capacitor APIs, such as <a href="/docs/apis/camera">Camera</a> and <a href="/docs/apis/filesystem">Filesystem</a>.</p>
<p>However, chances are your app will need to access more native functionality than provided out of the box in Capacitor.</p>
<p>If you are willing and able to write a small amount of native code, you can quickly add your own native functionality and expose it as a Capacitor plugin by following the <a href="/docs/plugins/">Plugin Guide</a>.</p>
<h2 id="finding-plugins">Finding Plugins</h2>
<p>The community has built a number of plugins for various native functionality, and you can easily add them to your app.</p>
<p>See our <a href="/docs/community/plugins/">Community Plugins</a> list for some options.</p>
<p>Capacitor also supports a wide range of <a href="/docs/basics/cordova">Cordova plugins</a>, so there are a lot to choose from.</p>
<h2 id="installing-plugins">Installing Plugins</h2>
<p>To install a Capacitor or Cordova plugin, simply run</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">npm install --save name-of-plugin
npx <span class="hljs-built_in">cap</span> update
</code></pre>
<p>Capacitor will detect the plugin and install it.</p>
<h2 id="updating-plugins">Updating Plugins</h2>
<p>To update a plugin, run</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">npm install --save name-of-plugin
npx <span class="hljs-built_in">cap</span> update
</code></pre>
<p>Capacitor will detect the new version of the plugin and install it.</p>
<h2 id="cordova-support">Cordova Support</h2>
<p>Capacitor supports a wide variety of Cordova plugins, but there are some things to keep in mind. Follow
