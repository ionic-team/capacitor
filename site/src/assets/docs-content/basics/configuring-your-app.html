<h1 id="configuring-your-app">Configuring Your App</h1>
<p>Capacitor embraces the idea of &quot;Code once, configure everywhere&quot;: configuration is
managed per-platform instead of in an abstracted system like a <code>config.xml</code> in Cordova, for example.</p>
<p>This is an important point, because it means that Capacitor requires you to be more involved in the native project configuration than with Cordova, for example. However,
we think this is the right approach, because it makes it easy to follow existing Native iOS/Android guides, get help on Stack Overflow, and have full control over your project.</p>
<p>Additionally, because configuring a Capacitor project is no different from configuring an iOS or Android project, existing native development teams can easily work alongside
web developers, with each side using the tools and SDKs they are familiar with. Of course, we believe web developers can handle all the required Native configuration on their own, and 
the Capacitor documentation exists to help web developers do just that.</p>
<h2 id="common-configuration">Common Configuration</h2>
<p>Capacitor has some high level configuration options that are set in <code>capacitor.config.json</code>. These generally don&#39;t modify native functionality, but control Capacitor&#39;s tooling.</p>
<p>The current ones you might configure are:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">{

  <span class="hljs-comment">// used to run your app in a native environment</span>
