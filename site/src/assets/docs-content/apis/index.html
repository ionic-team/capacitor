<h1 id="capacitor-apis">Capacitor APIs</h1>
<p>Capacitor includes a number of Native APIs that are available to all Capacitor apps. These can be thought of as Capacitor &quot;core plugins,&quot; and they make it easy to access commonly needed functionality on each platform.</p>
<p>For those coming from Cordova, the core Capacitor APIs cover much of the core Cordova plugins, and also include some new ones.</p>
<p>See the APIs list on the left menu for the full list of available APIs.</p>
