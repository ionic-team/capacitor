<h1 id="push-notifications">Push Notifications</h1>
<p>The Push Notifications API provides methods for registering a device to receive notifications from a server, along with processing received notifications and responding to them. In contrast, the <a href="../local-notifications">Local Notifications</a> API provides means for offline, local notification scheduling and processing.</p>
<h2 id="enabling-push-notifications-capabilites">Enabling Push Notifications Capabilites</h2>
<p>On iOS it&#39;s required to enable Push Notifications Capabilities in your project to make Push Notifications plugin work. To do so, go to the <code>Capabilities</code> section of your app and switch the <code>Push Notifications</code> button from <code>OFF</code> to <code>ON</code> possition.</p>
<p>That will add the push capabilites to your app and will create an entitlements file.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/docs/ios/enable-push-capabilities.png" alt="Enabling Push Notifications Capabilities"></p>
<p>On Android just download your app&#39;s <code>google-services.json</code> file from Firebase console and put it in <code>projectName/android/app</code> folder.</p>
<h2 id="push-notifications-icon">Push Notifications icon</h2>
<p>On Android, the Push Notifications icon with the appropriate name should be added to the <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;meta-data android:name=&quot;com.google.firebase.messaging.default_notification_icon&quot; android:resource=&quot;@mipmap/push_icon_name&quot; /&gt;
</code></pre><p>If no icon is specified Android will use the application icon, but push icon should be white pixels on a transparent backdrop. As the application icon is not usually like that, it will show a white square or circle. So it&#39;s recommended to provide the separate icon for Push Notifications.</p>
<p>Android Studio has an icon generator you can use to create your Push Notifications icon.</p>
<h2 id="disabling-push-notifications-plugin">Disabling Push Notifications plugin</h2>
<p>If you are not using Push Notifications in your project, when you submit the app to iTunes Connect, Apple will send you an email saying it has issues because of <code>Missing Push Notification Entitlement</code>. That happens because Capacitor includes the code for registering for push notifications and getting the token.</p>
<p>Apple sends that mail just to make sure you didn&#39;t make a mistake and forgot to enable Push Notifications Capabilities in your app, but can safely ignore it if you are not using the Push Notifications plugin.</p>
<p>In case you don&#39;t want to receive the mail, you can disable the Push Notifications plugin by removing <code>USE_PUSH</code> from <code>Active Compilation Conditions</code> in your project&#39;s Build Settings section.</p>

<h2 id="push-notifications-appearance-in-foreground">Push notifications appearance in foreground</h2>
<p>On iOS you can configure the way the push notifications are displayed when the app is in foreground by providing the <code>presentationOptions</code> in your <code>capacitor.config.json</code> as an Array of Strings you can combine.</p>
<p>Possible values are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>badge</code>: badge count on the app icon is updated (default value)</li>
<li><code>sound</code>: the devide will ring/vibrate when the push notification is received</li>
<li><code>alert</code>: the push notification is displayed in a native dialog</li>
</ul>
<p>An empty Array can be provided if none of the previous options are desired. <code>pushNotificationReceived</code> event will still be fired with the push notification information.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-json">&quot;plugins&quot;: {
  &quot;PushNotifications&quot;: {
    &quot;presentationOptions&quot;: [&quot;badge&quot;, &quot;sound&quot;, &quot;alert&quot;]
  }
}
</code></pre>
