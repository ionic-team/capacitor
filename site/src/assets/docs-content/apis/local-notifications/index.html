<h1 id="local-notifications">Local Notifications</h1>
<p>The Local Notification API provides a way to schedule &quot;local&quot; notifications - notifications that are scheduled and delivered on the device as opposed to &quot;push&quot; notifications sent from a server.</p>
<p>Local Notifications are great for reminding the user about a change in the app since they last visited, providing reminder features, and delivering offline information with the app being in the foreground.</p>
