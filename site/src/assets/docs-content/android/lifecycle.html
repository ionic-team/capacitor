<p>Understanding the Android Activity Lifecycle is crucial for building apps that act the way Android users expect.</p>
<p>This document attempts to explain the lifecycle as it pertains to Capacitor. For more information, the <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/activity-lifecycle.html">Activity Lifecycle</a> reference on the official Android docs is the best resource out there.</p>
<h2 id="handling-app-restarts">Handling App Restarts</h2>
<p>Android apps often utilize other apps (or Activities) for features that are too complicated to include in their own app, such as camera or browser features.</p>
<p>In some cases, when a device is low on memory, launching a new Activity may cause your app to be killed in order to free up memory.</p>
<p>In this case, when the new Activity returns data back to your app, your app will want to show the user a state of the app that resumes what the user was just doing.</p>
