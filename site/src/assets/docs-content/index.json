We call these apps \"Native Progressive Web Apps\" and they represent the next evolution beyond Hybrid apps.</p>\n\n<img src=\"/assets/img/docs/capacitor-index.png\" style=\"max-height: 360px\" />\n\n\n<h2 id=\"introduction\">\n  <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#introduction\"><ion-icon name=\"ios-link\"></ion-icon>\n  Introduction\n  </a>\n</h2>\n<p>Capacitor provides a consistent, web-focused set of APIs that enable an app to stay as close to web-standards as possible, while accessing rich native device features on platforms that support them. Adding native functionality is easy with a simple Plugin API for Swift on iOS, Java on Android, and JavaScript for the web.</p>\n<p>Capacitor is a spiritual successor to <a href=\"https://cordova.apache.org/\">Apache Cordova</a> and <a href=\"https://phonegap.com/\">Adobe PhoneGap</a>, with inspiration from other popular cross-platform tools like <a href=\"http://facebook.github.io/react-native/\">React Native</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks\">Turbolinks</a>, but focused entirely on enabling modern web apps to run on all major platforms with ease. Capacitor has backwards-compatible support for many existing <a href=\"https://cordova.apache.org/plugins/\">Cordova plugins</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"get-started\">\n  <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#get-started\"><ion-icon name=\"ios-link\"></ion-icon>\n  Get Started\n  </a>\n</h2>\n<p>Getting started with Capacitor is easy! Capacitor can be used as a drop in to any existing modern JavaScript project, or used to create a fresh Capacitor project from scratch.</p>\n<p>Follow the <stencil-route-link url=\"/docs/getting-started\">Installation</stencil-route-link> guide to get started building your app.</p>\n"}
