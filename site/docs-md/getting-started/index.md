# Getting Started With Capacitor

Capacitor provides a native mobile runtime and API layer for web apps. It does _not_ come with any specific
set of UI controls which you will most likely need.

We strongly recommend starting an Capacitor project with your mobile frontend framework of choice (such as Ionic),
though we also provide a vanilla TypeScript starter for apps that aren't using a frontend UI framework.

## Using Capacitor Starter with Ionic Framework

```bash
npm install -g ionic
ionic start myApp --with-avocado
```

## Using the Capacitor TypeScript Starter

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ionic-team/avocado-starter
```
