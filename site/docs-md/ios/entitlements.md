# Managing iOS Entitlements

Entitlements are used to enable key features that your app may need.

Unlike certain configuration options or usage descriptions, entitlements are configured in a special area inside of Xcode, rather than in Info.plist

If a plugin requires certain entitlements, open your app in Xcode, click on the name of your project in the left project menu, and select `Capabilities` in the tab bar.
