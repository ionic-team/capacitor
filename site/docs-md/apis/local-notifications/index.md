# Local Notifications

The Local Notification API provides a way to schedule "local" notifications - notifications that are scheduled and delivered on the device as opposed to "push" notifications sent from a server.

Local Notifications are great for reminding the user about a change in the app since they last visited, providing reminder features, and delivering offline information with the app being in the foreground.

## Example

```typescript
import { Plugins } from '@capacitor/core';
const { LocalNotifications } = Plugins;

LocalNotifications.schedule({
  notifications: [
    {
      title: "Title",
      body: "Body",
      id: 1,
      schedule: { at: new Date(Date.now() + 1000 * 5) },
      sound: null,
      attachments: null,
      actionTypeId: "",
      extra: null
    }
  ]
});
```
