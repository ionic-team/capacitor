# Local Notifications

The Local Notification API provides a way to schedule "local" notifications - notifications that are scheduled and delivered on the device as opposed to "push" notifications sent from a server.

Local Notifications are great for reminding the user about a change in the app since they last visited, providing reminder features, and delivering offline information with the app being in the foreground.
