# Capacitor APIs

Capacitor includes a number of Native APIs that are available to all Capacitor apps. These can be thought of as Capacitor "core plugins," and they make it easy to access commonly needed functionality on each platform.

For those coming from Cordova, the core Capacitor APIs cover much of the core Cordova plugins, and also include some new ones.

See the APIs list on the left menu for the full list of available APIs.
