# Capacitor Plugins

Plugins in Capacitor are centered around JavaScript APIs that call into Capacitor's runtime to perform
actions on the underlying platform.

Capacitor auto generates JavaScript hooks on the client, so most plugins only need to build
a native Swift/Obj-C plugin for iOS, and/or a Java one for Android. Of course, adding custom JavaScript
for a plugin is possible, and is just like providing a JavaScript npm package.

## Coming Soon

The plugins guide is a work in progress, slated for 0.2.0.
