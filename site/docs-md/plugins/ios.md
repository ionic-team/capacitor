# Capacitor iOS Plugin Guide

Building Capacitor plugins for iOS involves writing Swift (or Objective-C) to interface with Apple's iOS SDKs.

Capacitor embraces standard iOS development tools for building iOS plugins. We believe that using Swift (or, Objective-C) directly will make it easier to use existing solutions on Stack Overflow, share work with existing native developers, and use platform features as soon as they are made available.

## Getting Started

To get started, first generate a plugin as shown in the [Getting Started]('./#getting-started) section of the Plugin guide.

Next, open `your-plugin/ios/Plugin/Plugin.xcworkspace` in Xcode.
