# Building Electron Apps with Capacitor

Capacitor has preliminary support for [Electron](https://electronjs.org), the popular tool used for building desktop apps
with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

With Electron, Capacitor apps can run natively on Windows, Mac, and Linux!

Note: Electron support for Capacitor is currently in preview, and lags behind iOS, Android, and Web support. 

## Getting Started

After creating a new Capacitor app, add the `electron` platform:

```bash
npx cap add electron
```

This will generate a new Electron project in the `electron/` folder in the root of your app.

## Preparing your app

Just like the other Capacitor platforms, the `copy` command must be run periodically to sync web content with Electron:

```bash
npx cap copy
```

Run this after making any modifications to your web app.

## Running your App

To run your app, cd into it and use the npm script provided by Capacitor:

```
cd electron/
npm run electron:start
```

This will launch an Electron instance running your app.

## Plugin Support

Electron supports any plugin with a Web implementation, as well as a few plugins with custom Electron support (such as `Filesystem`).

We will have more info on building Electron plugins soon.

## Where to go next

That's pretty much all you need to know to build an Electron app with Capacitor!

Follow the [Development Workflow](../basics/workflow) guide to continue building and testing your app.
