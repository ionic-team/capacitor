# Avocado: Native Progressive Web Apps

Avocado is a cross-platform app runtime that makes it easy to deploy a Progressive Web App
natively on iOS, Android, Electron, *and* the web.

Avocado provides a consistent, web-focused set of APIs that enable an app to stay as close to web-standards as possible,
while accessing rich native device features on platforms that support them.

Avocado is a spiritual successor to Apache Cordova and Adobe PhoneGap, focused on enabling modern web apps to run on all major platforms with ease. Avocado has backwards-compatible support for many existing Cordova plugins.
