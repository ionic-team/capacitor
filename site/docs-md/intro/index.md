# Avocado: The Universal App Container

Avocado is a cross-platform app runtime that makes it easy to deploy a web application
on iOS, Android, Electron, and the web (such as a Progressive Web App).

Avocado provides a consistent, web-focused set of APIs that enable an app to stay as close to web-standards as possible,
while accessing rich native device features on platforms that support them.

Avocado is a spiritual successor to Apache Cordova and Adobe PhoneGap, focused on enabling modern web apps to run on all major platforms with ease. Avocado has backwards-compatible support for existing Cordova plugins.
