# Using Capacitor Plugins

Capacitor ships with a number of built-in plugins, known as Capacitor APIs, such as [Camera](/docs/apis/camera) and [Filesystem](/docs/apis/filesystem).

However, chances are your app will need to access more native functionality than provided out of the box in Capacitor.

If you are willing and able to write a small amount of native code, you can quickly add your own native functionality and expose it as a Capacitor plugin by following the [Plugin Guide](/docs/plugins/).

## Finding Plugins

The community has built a number of plugins for various native functionality and you can easily add them to your app.

See our [Community Plugins](/docs/community/plugins/) list for some options.

## Using Cordova and Ionic Native Plugins

Capacitor also supports a wide range of [Cordova plugins](/docs/cordova/using-cordova-plugins), so there are a lot to choose from.
