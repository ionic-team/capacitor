# Creating Apps

To Create new apps, you'll either clone a starter project, use a framework CLI tool (like Ionic CLI), or drop-in Capacitor to an existing frontend project.

Follow the <stencil-route-link url="/docs/getting-started/">Getting Started</stencil-route-link> guide for instructions on each of these ways of using Capacitor.
