# Capacitor Starter

This is a starter project for new Capacitor apps.

Capacitor also works as a drop-in to any existing frontend web project. If you'd like to use Capacitor in that way, refer
to the documentation (coming soon).

## Getting Started

Note: Capacitor requires Node 8.6.0 or later.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ionic-team/capacitor-starter my-app
cd my-app
npm install
npm run capacitor init
```

Then follow the Getting Started guide (coming soon) for building and testing your app!
