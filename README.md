# Capacitor: Cross-platform apps with JavaScript and the Web

Capacitor is a cross-platform API layer that makes it easy to call Native SDKs from web code, as well as providing first-class Progressive Web App support so you can write one app and deploy it to the app stores, _and_ the mobile web.

Capacitor is still a work in progress and is not quite ready for use. Stay tuned for a public release in early 2018.
